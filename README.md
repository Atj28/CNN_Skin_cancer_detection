## **General Information**  
This project focuses on building a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to **accurately detect melanoma**, a deadly form of skin cancer. The model is trained on **dermatological images** to distinguish between malignant and benign oncological diseases.  

## **Problem Statement**  
Melanoma is a type of **skin cancer** that accounts for **75% of skin cancer deaths**. Early detection is critical to improving survival rates.  
This project aims to develop a **CNN-based deep learning model** that can evaluate dermatological images and assist dermatologists in identifying melanoma early, thereby reducing **manual effort** and improving diagnostic accuracy.  

## **Dataset Information**  
- The dataset consists of **2357 images** of **malignant and benign oncological diseases**, collected from the **International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)**.  
- The dataset is **imbalanced**, with melanoma and nevus images slightly dominant over other categories.  
- The dataset includes images for the following **8 skin diseases**:  
  - **Actinic keratosis**  
  - **Basal cell carcinoma**  
  - **Dermatofibroma**  
  - **Melanoma**  
  - **Nevus**  
  - **Pigmented benign keratosis**  
  - **Seborrheic keratosis**  
  - **Squamous cell carcinoma**  
  - **Vascular lesion**  

## **Technologies Used**  
- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow/Keras - `2.x`  
- OpenCV - `4.x`  
- NumPy - `1.x`  
- Matplotlib - `3.x`  
- Scikit-learn - `0.x`  

## **Results & Conclusions**  
### **1. Baseline Model (Without Dropout & Augmentation)**  
- **Training Accuracy:** ~92%  
- **Validation Accuracy:** ~51%  
- **Observation:** The model **overfitted** to the training data, leading to poor generalization.  

### **2. Model with Dropout Regularization**  
- **Training Accuracy:** ~66%  
- **Validation Accuracy:** ~51%  
- **Observation:** Dropout **reduced overfitting** and improved validation accuracy.  

### **3. Model with Data Augmentation**  
- **Training Accuracy:** ~81%  
- **Validation Accuracy:** ~62%  
- **Observation:** Data augmentation **improved generalization**, exposing the model to more diverse samples.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
✅ **Overfitting was reduced** by introducing **dropout**.  
✅ **Data augmentation** improved the model’s **robustness**.  
✅ **Class imbalance** affected performance; rebalancing techniques helped stabilize the model.  
✅ The final model achieved **better generalization** with **dropout + augmentation**.  

## **Next Steps for Improvement**  
- **Hyperparameter tuning** (learning rate, batch size, number of layers).  
- **Use of pre-trained models** (e.g., **VGG16, ResNet50**) for transfer learning.  
- **Class balancing techniques** (oversampling minority classes or using weighted loss functions).  
- **Incorporating more data** to further improve model performance.
